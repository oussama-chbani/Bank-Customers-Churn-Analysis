# Bank-Customers-Churn-Analysis

![](Project_picture.png)


## Introduction
This is a Tableau project on churn analysis of an imaginary bank dataset.
The project aims to uncover the underlying reasons why customers choose to leave the bank. 
Customer churn analysis is crucial for understanding the factors that drive customers away, enabling the bank to take informed actions to reduce churn, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize its operations.

## Problem Statement
The primary challenge addressed in this project is to identify and understand the motivations and reasons behind customer churn within the bank. By analyzing various customer attributes and behaviors, we seek to answer the question: **"Why do bank customers choose to churn?"** This understanding will enable the bank to develop targeted strategies to mitigate churn and strengthen customer relationships.

## Data Sourcing
### Data Description
The dataset used for this analysis consists of 18 fields (columns) and 10,000 rows, representing customer information and behavior within the bank. Key columns in the dataset include customer demographics, credit scores, account balances, product ownership, tenure, and whether a customer has churned or not.

### Data Collection
The data was sourced from an external dataset repository, specifically from Kaggle. It provides a snapshot of the bank's customer base, which forms the basis for our analysis.

## Data Cleaning / Transformation
Prior to analysis, data cleaning was performed to address issues such as missing values, data inconsistencies, and irrelevant columns. This step ensures that the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis.

The following key metrics were calculated to both help identify data quality issues, and provide context for subsequent analysis:
- Number of records: COUNT([Customer Id])
- Number of Unique Customers: COUNTD([Customer Id])
- Number of Churned Customers
- Churn Rate
- Average Number of Products per Customer
- Average Customer Age
